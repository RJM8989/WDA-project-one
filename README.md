This project was to design a front-end website for Darren's Barbershop, based on a real-life barbershop in London called Austin's Barbershop. The aim of this project was that the website would generate traffic from a wider audience to help increase the number of new customers for the business as well as cater for existing customers through the use of a booking form. The website also has information for new and existing customers such as a description of each barber, the address, a Google map, etc...

## UX


The strategy of the website was to promote the business and attract both physical and virtual traffic. To achieve this, I researched similar websites to analyze how they advertised their business and the services they offered. Based on my research for the scope, I decided to include a price list, the business location, and a way for users to interact with the website, which led me to include a contact form and a booking form. Additionally, I added pictures of the staff and the services offered on the website.

For the skeleton and structure of the website, I used Figma for the wireframes. I decided to have a simple navbar at the top of the page, with three pages: Home, Contact/Meet the Team, and Price List. The Home page included an introduction and pictures of hairstyles and previous customers. The Contact/Meet the Team page introduced the staff and provided information such as the business location, opening times, a map, and a contact form. Finally, the Price List page listed the services and allowed users to book a service and choose their preferred barber.

At the surface level, I added a carousel to the website, so users could look at pictures of the business. For the location, I chose a Google map because it was interactive and provided information on transport links and landmarks. The contact and book forms had multicoloured buttons to improve accessibility, and I chose a colour scheme that contrasted bold and bright colours with brown, red, and silver grey for the text.


### Colour Scheme



Explain your colours and the colour scheme.


- `#D9D9D9` used for primary text.
- `#514d42` used for primary background color.
- `#8f8f8f` used for buttons and social media links.
- `#A30B37` used for button hover feature.



I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/514d42-d9d9d9-a30b370) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography


- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) was used for the primary headers, titles, and all other secondary text.


- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile and desktop sizes.
I've used both [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/recents-and-sharing/recently-viewed?fuid=1312128635675800480) to design my site wireframes.

### Desktop Wireframes

These screenshots were taken before the start of the project throughout the design process the pages have slight variations compared to the original wireframe.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **NAVBAR**

    - The navbar is an interactive feature on the website that allows users to navigate around, the benefit to the site is that it allows users to navigate the website easier and find the pages they're either on or want to find. 
    

![screenshot](assets/Documentation/feature01.png)

- **CAROUSEL**

    - The carousel is an interactive feature on the website that allows images to be added to the website, to help advertise the business. 
    At the moment it contains pictures of customers and the staff that work at the company. it allows the user to see the types of haircuts available and familiarise themselves with the staff.


![screenshot](assets/Documentation/feature02.png)

    - The social media links show the various social media apps used by the business. It helps to build loyalty and trust in your brand, to help advertise the business, and to interact directly with customers in real time. It allows the user to interact with the business.

- **GOOGLE MAPS**

    - The Map shows the business location, the benefit of the Google map is that it's interactive and shows landmarks and transport links around the business. The benefit for the user is that it’s an interactive map so both existing and current users can plan their journey to the business.

### Future Features


- BOOKING FORM AND CONTACT US FORM
    
   - A number of the limitations are both the booking form and the contact us form. The Contact Us form on HTML only allows a response sent message, whereas, with a back-end application such as PHP I can design an interactive contact form, an e-mail would be sent to the address of the inquiry, alongside a message confirming acknowledgment, and JavaScript so I can design an interactive booking form where it would have a calendar and a time to book a particular service and a preferred barber, the availability of the barbers and the ability to pay for services directly online and more interaction with customers, for example, the Pall Mall barbershop [website](https://www.pallmallbarbers.com/) you can see how much better the interaction with customers is. They have a booking form via a booking service like the Fresha online booking app [website](https://www.fresha.com/), with multiple locations available, a calendar, and a choice of staff and service.

- GOOGLE REVIEWS
    - Google reviews can increase online visibility and exposure, and positive reviews can boost your search engine rankings which in turn increases your online visibility and traffic. increase brand trust because people trust reviews from other customers. They also improve customer experience and help you gain a competitive advantage through both negative and positive feedback and customer interaction when a review is submitted, businesses can respond and engage with that customer.
