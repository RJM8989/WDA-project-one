This project was to design a front-end website for Darren's Barbershop. The aims of this project was that the website would generate traffic from a wider audience to help increase the amonut of new customers for the business as well as catering for existing customers through the use of a booking form. The website also has information for new and existing customers such as an decription of each barber, the address, a google map, etc...

## UX


In this section, you will briefly explain your design processes.


### Colour Scheme



Explain your colours and the colour scheme.


- `#D9D9D9` used for primary text.
- `#514d42` used for primary background color.
- `#8f8f8f` used for button and social media links.
- `#A30B37` used for button hover feature.



I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/514d42-d9d9d9-a30b370) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography


- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) was used for the primary headers, titles and all other secondary text.


- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.
Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

Alternatively, dropdowns are a way to condense several wireframes into a collapsible menu to save space.
Dropdowns in Markdown are considered some of the only acceptable HTML components that are allowed for assessment purposes.


To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile and desktop sizes.
I've used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/recents-and-sharing/recently-viewed?fuid=1312128635675800480) to design my site wireframes.

### Desktop Wireframes

These screenshots were taken before the start of the project throughout the design process the pages have slight variations compared to the orginal wireframe.

### Future Features


- BOOKING FORM AND CONTACT US FORM
    - A number of the limitations are the both the booking form and the contact us form.
    The contact us form on html only allows response sent message, whereas with a back-end aplication an e-mail would be sent to the adress of the inquiry, alongside a message comfirmed acknowledgement.

     - With booking form again its only html, so the respsonse is limited and just a 'message received' message. A back-end apllication would allow more interaction such as a calendar to show avialbility of the barbers, the ablility to pay for services directly online and more interaction with customers for example like the Pall Mall barbershop [website](https://www.pallmallbarbers.com/)
  you can see better ineraction they have a booking form via a booking service like Fresha online booking app [website](https://www.fresha.com/), with mulitple locations available, a calendar and choice of staff and service.

- SHOP
    - A shop isn't really realstic without a back-end apllication. A shop would allow more interaction with new and existing customers and a opportunity for the expansion of the business by alowing the business to prodvide grooming products for sale and the ablility for users to pay for services directly online and more interaction with customers for example like the Murdock of London barbershop [website](https://www.murdocklondon.com/) you can see better interaction they have a shop which sells various grooming products.
